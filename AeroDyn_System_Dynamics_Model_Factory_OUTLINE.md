- External System Modeling & AI Task Force

## 2. What the board asked for — and the question we focus on
- Not one giant model; a repeatable way to build small, focused models for different strategic questions, with as little friction as possible.
- Focus: What happens to our long-term business if we heavily invest in lethal AI? How do public opinion, regulation, and contracts interact over 5–10 years?
- Mechanism: Lethal AI visibility → backlash → regulation → reputation → contract pipeline. Scenarios: base, high investment, stronger backlash, diversification.

---

## 3. Reframing the question — from yes/no to conditions
- Typical: “Should we invest in AI-controlled lethal weapons?” (yes/no) → doesn’t help explore when it pays off or backfires.
- Reframe: “Under what conditions does investing in lethal AI improve or harm our long-term position?”
- Mechanisms + levers (pace, diversification, transparency) + scenarios = strategic options, not a single number.

## 4. What you get: insight, speed, reliability — and how it works
- **Insight:** One question per model; see backlash, regulation, reputation, contracts over 5–10 years. Scenarios in minutes.
- **Speed:** Model Brief = contract (one page). New question → new model in hours to days. Same engine for all.
- **Reliability:** Explicit assumptions (stocks, flows, parameters); editable and auditable. No black box.
- **Process:** One question → one model. Building blocks reused. Scenarios, not point forecasts. Transparent and updatable.

---

## 5. Key mechanisms the model captures
- Lethal AI visibility → Public/ethical backlash (reacts to visibility; decays with media cycle).
- Backlash → Regulatory pressure (export controls, certification); eases with policy cycle.
- Backlash erodes Reputation (license to operate); transparency/compliance recover it.
- Reputation builds Contract pipeline; delivery drains it; regulation constrains it.

## 6. Architecture & what’s systematic vs human judgment
- **Repeatable:** Single schema (stocks, flows, parameters); one engine builds ODEs and diagram from it. JSON in/out; GenAI can draft schema, human loads and validates.
- **Systematic:** Schema, simulation, diagram, import/export. Same inputs → same results.
- **Human:** What to include/exclude, how to interpret conflicting info, time horizon, parameter choices, reinterpretation of the question (e.g. yes/no → under what conditions).

---

## 7. Trade-offs & what we don’t promise
- Simplicity over realism: small, explainable models; add another model for another question. GenAI assists; humans validate; provenance visible.
- No calibration on hard data yet: scenario-based exploration; assumptions documented.
- No perfect predictions; no single right answer. Models help you reason and compare options; choices (scope, interpretation, horizon) stay with you.

---

## 8. Demo & bottom line
- **15-min demo:** Pick question → load model (stocks, flows, loops) → change params or scenario → run → see “So what?” interpretation. Just the picture and the numbers.
- **Bottom line:** Credible, repeatable way to turn strategic questions into simple system-dynamics models the board can understand. Same approach for the next question — a library of small models, human choices explicit.

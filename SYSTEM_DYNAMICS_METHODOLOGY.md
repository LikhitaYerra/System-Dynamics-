# System Dynamics Methodology for Strategic Options
## External Task Force – Repeatable Build Process

**Purpose:** Give both boards a **repeatable way** to build small, focused system dynamics models—not one big model. Each engagement produces a **single strategic question** answered by a **bounded model**, with minimal friction and few clarifying questions.

---

## 1. Core principle: One question, one model

- **Do not** build a firm-wide mega-model.
- **Do** build a sequence of small models, each answering one strategic “what if” or “how does X interact with Y?”
- Reuse the same process every time; reuse building blocks (stocks, flows, feedback loops) across models where they fit.

---

## 2. Repeatable process (four phases)

| Phase | What happens | Output | Friction reducer |
|-------|----------------|--------|-------------------|
| **A. Scope** | Board/sponsor fills a short **Model Brief** (see template). Task force may do one short clarification call. | Signed-off Model Brief | One-page template; no long discovery. |
| **B. Map** | Task force drafts a causal loop diagram (CLD) or stock-flow sketch for the question. One review round with sponsor. | Agreed map (CLD + optional SFD outline) | Reuse archetypes (see building blocks). |
| **C. Build** | Implement in your SD tool; calibrate with sponsor-provided or public data; run base + 2–4 scenarios. | Working model + scenario set | Standard scenario set (base, optimistic, pessimistic, 1–2 policy levers). |
| **D. Use** | Present results; document assumptions and limits; archive model and brief for reuse. | Report + archived model + updated brief | One-page “model passport” (purpose, scope, limits). |

## 3. Model Brief (the only mandatory input)

The **Model Brief** is the contract for each model. It forces one question and a clear boundary so the task force does not need to ask many follow-ups.

- **Strategic question** (one sentence): e.g. “How might export controls on AI components affect our delivery timelines and revenue in the next 3–5 years?”
- **Decision maker**: Who will use this? (e.g. Board, Strategy, Product.)
- **Time horizon**: e.g. 3, 5, 10 years.
- **In scope**: 3–5 key variables or subsystems (e.g. “supply chain, R&D capacity, regulatory approvals”).
- **Out of scope**: What we explicitly ignore (e.g. “competitor pricing, merger M&A”).
- **Context flag** (for AeroDyn / regulated sectors): Ethical or political sensitivities (e.g. “lethal vs non-lethal product mix”, “public perception”, “ministerial oversight”). This shapes scenario design and documentation.

Once the Brief is agreed, the task force runs Phases B–D without needing to reopen scope.

## 4. Reusable building blocks (archetypes)

To start quickly and keep models comparable across engagements, use a small set of **generic structures** and instantiate them for each Brief.

- **Capacity–demand** (stocks: capacity, backlog; flows: orders, delivery, capacity expansion). Use for delivery timelines, resource planning.
- **Adoption / diffusion** (stock: adopters or “systems in use”; flows: adoption, retirement; feedback: word-of-mouth, saturation). Use for new AI capabilities, platform rollout.
- **Reputation / trust** (stock: perceived trust or reputation; flows: positive/negative events, decay). Use for public/ministry perception, ethical scrutiny.
- **Pipeline** (multi-stage stock: R&D → integration → certification → delivery). Use for product development, regulatory milestones.
- **Resource competition** (shared resource; multiple projects or business lines competing). Use for R&D allocation, dual-use vs civilian focus.

For each new model, the task force picks 1–2 archetypes that match the Brief and customizes names and parameters—no need to invent structure from scratch.

---

## 5. Scenario set (standard)

To keep runs comparable and reduce “what should we run?” questions:

- **Base**: Current policies and assumptions.
- **Optimistic / Pessimistic**: Same structure, different key assumptions (e.g. regulation, demand, funding).
- **1–2 policy levers**: e.g. “+20% R&D”, “delay certification by 12 months”, “shift 10% portfolio to non-lethal”.

All scenarios are defined in the Model Brief or in a one-page scenario sheet derived from it.

---

## 6. Context-specific note: AeroDyn (defense, Europe)

- **Ethical/political scrutiny**: Every Model Brief for AeroDyn should include a “Context flag” (see above). Scenarios should explicitly vary **lethal vs non-lethal mix**, **oversight intensity**, or **public perception** when relevant.
- **Documentation**: Models that touch targeting, lethality, or autonomous decision support should have a short “assumptions and limits” note suitable for internal or ministerial review.
- **Reuse**: The same methodology applies; only the Brief template and scenario labels need to reflect defense/ministry context. No separate mega-model.

---

## 7. What “minimal friction” means in practice

- **One mandatory artifact**: The Model Brief. No long discovery workshops.
- **One review round** on the map (Phase B) before building.
- **Standard scenarios** (base, optimistic, pessimistic, 1–2 levers) unless the Brief explicitly asks otherwise.
- **One-page “model passport”** at the end: question, scope, main assumptions, limits, file location. Enables reuse and audit.

## 8. Summary

| Want | How |
|------|-----|
| No one big model | One question → one model; many small models over time. |
| Repeatable build | Same four phases (Scope → Map → Build → Use) every time. |
| As little friction as possible | Model Brief + archetypes + standard scenarios + one review on the map. |
| Strategic options exploration | Each model compares scenarios (base, optimistic, pessimistic, policy levers). |
| Works for both firms | Same process; AeroDyn (and similar) use Context flag and documentation for ethical/regulatory sensitivity. |

*Next steps: Use the Model Brief template for the first engagement; select 1–2 building-block archetypes; run Phase B (map) and one review before building.*

# Model Brief — [Working title, e.g. “Export controls & delivery timelines”]

**One-page scope for a single system dynamics model. Complete this before Phase B (Map).**

---

## 1. Strategic question (one sentence)

*What decision or “what if” should this model inform?*

> Example: *“How might export controls on AI components affect our delivery timelines and revenue over the next 3–5 years?”*

**Question:**  
_______________________________________________________________________________

---

## 2. Decision maker & use

| Field | Answer |
|-------|--------|
| **Who will use this?** | (e.g. Board, Strategy, Product, Ministry liaison) |
| **How will it be used?** | (e.g. annual strategy offsite, budget round, risk review) |

---

## 3. Time horizon

| Field | Answer |
|-------|--------|
| **Model horizon** | _____ years (e.g. 3, 5, 10) |
| **Time step** | (e.g. month, quarter, year) |

---

## 4. Scope (in / out)

**In scope (3–5 key variables or subsystems):**

1.  
2.  
3.  
4.  
5.  

**Out of scope (explicitly not in this model):**

-  
-

## 5. Context flag (mandatory for AeroDyn / regulated / sensitive contexts)

*Ethical, political, or regulatory sensitivities that should shape scenarios and documentation.*

- [ ] Lethal vs non-lethal product mix  
- [ ] Public or ministerial perception / trust  
- [ ] Oversight or certification intensity  
- [ ] Other: _______________________________________________

**Short note:**

## 6. Suggested building blocks (optional — task force can propose)

*From the methodology: Capacity–demand | Adoption/diffusion | Reputation/trust | Pipeline | Resource competition*

**Likely archetypes for this question:**

## 7. Scenarios to run (optional — default: base + optimistic + pessimistic + 1–2 levers)

| Scenario | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Base | |
| Optimistic | |
| Pessimistic | |
| Policy lever 1 | |
| Policy lever 2 | |

## 8. Sign-off

| Role | Name | Date |
|------|------|------|
| Sponsor | | |
| Task force lead | | |

*After sign-off, proceed to Phase B (Map). Do not expand scope without a new Brief or Brief amendment.*

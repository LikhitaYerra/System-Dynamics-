# EuroMotion Automotive — Model Brief
## Supply chain resilience & delivery throughput

**Strategic question (one sentence):**  
How do semiconductor and battery supply shocks affect order backlog and delivery throughput over a 5-year horizon?

**Decision maker:** Board / Operations / Supply chain  
**Use:** Strategic options; supply chain risk and dual-sourcing.  
**Time horizon:** 5 years  
**Time step:** Month  

**In scope:**  
1. Order backlog (EV / software-defined vehicle orders)  
2. Production throughput (capacity- and supply-limited)  
3. Semiconductor supply (inventory and replenishment)  
4. Battery supply (inventory and replenishment)  
5. Cumulative deliveries  

**Out of scope:** Pricing, competitor behaviour, detailed OEM contracts (separate model).  

**Context flag:**  
- Complex global supply chains (semiconductors, batteries)  
- Supply shocks and recovery; dual-sourcing / resilience levers  

**Building blocks:** Capacity–demand (backlog, capacity, deliveries); supply constraint (chip and battery inventory stocks).  

**Scenarios:** Base (no shock) | Semiconductor shock | Battery shock | Dual shock + recovery | Resilience (faster replenishment).

# AeroDyn Systems — Model Brief
## Pipeline & Ministerial Trust

**Strategic question (one sentence):**  
How do certification delays and the lethal vs non-lethal portfolio mix affect delivery pipeline and ministerial trust over a 5-year horizon?

**Decision maker:** Board / Strategy  
**Use:** Strategic options exploration; portfolio and oversight sensitivity.  
**Time horizon:** 5 years  
**Time step:** Month  

**In scope:**  
1. R&D pipeline (programs in development)  
2. Integration (AI-enabled systems in integration)  
3. Certification queue (awaiting ministerial/defense certification)  
4. Deliveries (systems certified and delivered)  
5. Ministerial trust (stakeholder trust index 0–100)  

**Out of scope:** Competitor behaviour, M&A, detailed pricing, export controls (can be added in a separate model).  

**Context flag (AeroDyn):**  
- Lethal vs non-lethal product mix (trust gain higher for non-lethal deliveries)  
- Oversight intensity (slows certification rate)  
- Ministerial perception and ethical scrutiny  

**Building blocks:** Pipeline (R&D → Integration → Certification → Delivery); Reputation/trust (trust gains from deliveries, decay, non-lethal premium).  

**Scenarios:** Base | High oversight (slower cert) | Higher non-lethal share (trust bonus) | Combined.

# AeroDyn Systems — Model Brief: Lethal AI & long-term business

**Strategic question (one sentence):**  
What happens to our long-term business if we heavily invest in lethal AI, and how do public opinion, regulation, and contracts interact over 5–10 years?

**Decision maker:** Board / Strategy  
**Use:** Strategic options exploration; sensitivity to investment pace, transparency, and portfolio mix.  
**Time horizon:** 5–10 years  
**Time step:** Month  

**In scope:**  
1. Lethal AI visibility (how much the market and public see us as “lethal AI” invested)  
2. Public / ethical backlash  
3. Regulatory pressure (export controls, certification, oversight)  
4. Reputation (license to operate, trust)  
5. Contract pipeline (value at stake, access to markets)  

**Out of scope:** Competitor behaviour, M&A, detailed R&D pipeline stages (covered by the separate Pipeline & Trust model), specific product pricing. *“Will AI performance be sufficient?”* is not a separate stock here; it can be explored as a scenario (e.g. lower contract attractiveness or slower reputation recovery if AI underperforms) or added as a lever in a follow-on model.  

**Context flag (AeroDyn):**  
- [x] Lethal vs non-lethal product mix (captured indirectly via “visibility” and diversification)  
- [x] Public or ministerial perception / trust (Reputation, Backlash)  
- [x] Oversight or certification intensity (Regulatory pressure)  

**Building blocks:** Reputation/trust; Adoption/diffusion (visibility of lethal AI).  

**Scenarios:** Base | Higher investment (faster visibility growth) | Stronger backlash sensitivity | More diversification (visibility decay) | Combined (e.g. high investment + high recovery).

## Reinterpretation of the management question (bonus)

**Initial question (typical):** “Should we invest in AI-controlled lethal weapons?” (yes/no.)

**Limitation:** A yes/no answer doesn’t help the board explore *under what conditions* such investment pays off or backfires.

**Reframe we use:**  
“Under what conditions does investing in lethal AI improve or harm our long-term position?”  

That implies:  
- Modelling **mechanisms** (visibility → backlash → regulation → reputation → contracts), not just a single go/no-go.  
- Exploring **levers**: pace of investment, diversification (reducing “lethal AI visibility”), transparency and compliance (reputation recovery), and sensitivity of regulation to backlash.  
- **Scenarios** instead of one forecast: e.g. “If we invest heavily and backlash is strong, what happens to reputation and contracts? If we diversify and invest in recovery, can we stabilise?”  

So the model supports **strategic options**: it doesn’t answer “yes or no” but “what happens if we choose this path vs that path?”. The board can then decide with a clearer view of trade-offs and uncertainties.
